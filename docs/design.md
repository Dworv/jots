Problem Statement: Having all my productive tools in one place is hard
- Its inconvenient to link thoughts together
- I often can't access my notes on all my devices
- I don't really want to share my personal thoughts with Google

The goal of Jots is to help people get everything they possibly can out of their most import tool: their brain.

Jots should support the following features:

- [] Notes
  - [] Text
  - [] Images
  - [] Media
  - [] User Organization
  - [] Sketches
- [] Journal
- [] Calendar
  - [] Sync with other calendars
- [] Self-hosting
- [] Server hosting
